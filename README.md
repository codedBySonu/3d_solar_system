# 🌌 3D Solar System Simulation

A visually interactive 3D Solar System simulation created using Python.
This project displays the Sun and all planets with realistic textures and basic orbital motion.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project was created as an educational and visualization tool to help understand:

- The structure of our solar system  
- Planetary positions and motion  
- How computer graphics can be used for simulations  

The solar system is represented in a 3D environment where each planet rotates and orbits around the Sun using real texture images for better realism.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Graphics:** OpenGL (via Python bindings)  
- **Frameworks/Libraries:**
  - PyOpenGL
  - pygame (for window and event handling)
  - numpy (for calculations)
  - math (for transformations)

## ⚙️ How This Project Was Created

1. We first set up the Python OpenGL environment.
2. Created a 3D window using pygame + OpenGL.
3. Modelled spherical objects to represent planets.
4. Applied real planet texture images on each sphere.
5. Implemented:
   - Planet rotation
   - Planet revolving around the sun
6. Adjusted lighting and camera for a realistic space effect.

## 📦 Required Libraries

Install required libraries before running:
1. pygame

Used for creating the window and handling input/events.

2. PyOpenGL

Used for rendering 3D graphics with OpenGL.

3. numpy

Used for mathematical calculations (rotation, positions, matrices, etc.)

4. math (Built-in)

Already comes with Python, no need to install.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Planned improvements for future versions:

- Add orbit path lines for planets
- Add realistic scale for distances and sizes
- Add Moon orbiting the Earth
- Add Saturn rings with transparency
- Add zoom and camera control with keyboard/mouse
- Add real-time speed control
- Add labels for planet names on hover
